            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    Peel and cut 4 medium russet potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Place the potatoes in a large pot 
                    and add enough cold water to cover potatoes by 1 inch. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt. 
                    Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover and reduce heat to low to maintain a gentle simmer. 
                    Cook until potatoes are easily pierced with a 
                    knife but not falling apart, 12 to 14 minutes. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with paper towels. 
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Drain the potatoes, then transfer onto a baking sheet and spread into a single layer. 
                    Pat the potatoes dry with more towels and let cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mince 2 garlic cloves, 
                    coarsely chop the leaves from 1/2 bunch fresh parsley, and finely shred 1 ounce 
                    Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup). Microwave 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large microwave-safe 
                    bowl until melted, about 30 seconds. Add the garlic, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon 
                    black pepper, and the remaining 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and stir to combine. Set aside. 
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 10-inch cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high 
                    heat until shimmering. Working in batches if needed, add the potatoes and cook, stirring 
                    and flipping them often, until golden-brown and crisp on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes total. 
                    Transfer the potatoes into the bowl of 
                    garlic butter and toss to coat. Transfer into a serving bowl and garnish with the Parmesan. 
                </ol>
