            <h2>The Secret to Better Home Fries? Cook Them Like the French Do</h2>
            <p>Pommes persillade might sound fancy, but the homey side dish — a staple on bistro menus 
              — is incredibly easy to make at home. Crispy potatoes with soft, tender centers are tossed 
              in melted butter, minced garlic, and fresh parsley to create the ultimate side dish. 
              It’s like the classic diner home fries you know and love, only elevated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The trick to getting these potatoes super crispy is to boil them in salted water before 
              pan-frying them. This does two things: It cooks the potatoes all the way through so they 
              are perfectly tender, and it helps bring some of the potatoes’ gelatinized starches to the 
              surface so the potatoes get nice and crispy. To do this, you’ll cover diced potatoes with cold water, 
              bring to a boil, drain them, and let them dry on a sheet tray, where they’ll cool for at least 
              10 minutes to allow the excess water to evaporate. Then, fry them in a hot skillet to crisp them up. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, we’re garnishing the crispy spuds with shredded Parmesan cheese to amp up their savoriness, 
              but you can leave it out and still end up with a delicious side dish. Serve them immediately to
              maintain their crispy texture and pair with your favorite protein for the ultimate weeknight dinner.
